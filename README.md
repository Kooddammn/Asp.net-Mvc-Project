# Travel Agency Software Solution
Basic Idea behind the Project: The travel agencies have to manage a lot of cars/buses with the details of drivers and a lot of passengers. So, managing this data manually is a tedious task. The Cab Management System is a web-based solution for this manual tedious work and helps the agencies manage the data very easily.

1.Administration Module: The admin can enter the application using the login credentials and have complete control over the application. The admin can have various functionalities like adding some latest topics of discussion, updating the policies of the discussion forum, etc. The admin also should have the access to delete a discussion post if the admin finds it inappropriate. Also, the admin can delete the account of users who he/she might find inappropriate.

2.User module: The user also has to log in via valid credentials. However, the user should not have that much control over the application. Users should be able to add a question, leave a like on a discussion post, and comment his/her own answer. Users can also be given the feature to report another user and the admin can then look over it.
