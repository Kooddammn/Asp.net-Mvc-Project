# Travel Agency Software Solution
Basic Idea behind the Project: The travel agencies have to manage a lot of cars/buses with the details of drivers and a lot of passengers. So, managing this data manually is a tedious task. The Cab Management System is a web-based solution for this manual tedious work and helps the agencies manage the data very easily.

# Project Description:

    1.Administration Department: Again, this project is also designed solely for the administration side. The admin has to log in first via a valid e-mail ID and               password     and also the option to change the password should be provided. The admin should be given the option to add as many managers as he/she wants to.             Admin should have full access to add, delete or modify manager records.

    2.Finance Module: The finance manager is required to log in to the application via the credentials and the manager should also be given the option to change the           password. All the financial tasks such as updating the vehicle billing details, payments, etc. should be done by the finance manager.

    3.HR module: This module requires a Human Resource Manager to log in using the credentials. The HR manager should get all the options to add, remove, and edit the          details of the employees. There can be various employees in the car agency like receptionists, drivers, cleaners, etc.

    4.Travel Module: This module requires a travel manager to log in using the required credentials. The options available to the travel manager should be like                 allotting the routes to the drivers, allotting the cars to the drivers, estimating the travel cost for a journey, etc. Vehicle maintenance can also be done by           the travel manager only.</li>
